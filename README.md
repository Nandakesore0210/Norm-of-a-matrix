# Norm of a matrix
## Aim
To write a program to find the 1-norm, 2-norm and infinity norm of the matrix and display the result in two decimal places.
## Equipment’s required:
1.	Hardware – PCs
2.	Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner
## Algorithm:

### 1-Norm of a Matrix<br>
	

### 2-Norm of a Matrix <br>
      

### Infinity Norm of a Matrix <br>
       
## Program:

Program to find 2-norm of a matrix.

# 1-Norm of a Matrix

```

```

# 2-Norm of a Matrix
```

```
# Infinity Norm of a Matrix
```

```

## Output:
### 1-Norm of a Matrix


### 2-Norm of a Matrix


### Infinity Norm of a Matrix


## Result
Thus the program for 1-norm, 2-norm and Infinity norm of a matrix are written and verified.
